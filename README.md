# EventHive - Local Event Discovery Website

## Description


In an era where technology is used in every corner of the world, our initial idea was to make a system called ‘Event Hive’ where people could use a website in order to see and be notified about the upcoming and ongoing events in their local area, this website will have two main roles, event owners and visitors. 
The event owners will be able to post their event after a verification process done by the backend staff, they will have a separate user interface to change the image, date, description, venues and to display the time of the events and the system will be updated accordingly. Furthermore, event owners can make their contact information public (so, visitors can contact them) and they can mention ticket prices to participate in the event.
The visitors will have another separate user interface which is able to view different types of events like Musical Events, Charity Events, Sports Events around the country with all the information such as images, date, venue, description, time, contact information, ticket prices etc. And if needed the visitors will have an option to filter and select a specific area through their location to find nearby events. 
This system will also have a review and commentary section which can be used by the users when the event is ongoing or after concluded. 
The system will also have a notification system where the users will be notified when a new event is registered. Notifications will be sent through emails. The users will have the option to have this functionality on or off. 
This system can be accessible by both mobile and PC users via a Web Browser. 
This system will be powered by a Linux Server, an Apache web server, and a MySQL database. The system will be available to users at all times.
